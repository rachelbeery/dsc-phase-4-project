<img src='https://github.com/rachelbeery/dsc-phase-4-project/blob/main/FEMA-1.jpg'>

## Project Overview

In this project we are using a time series model to understand the patterns of natural disasters declarations in the United States. By understanding these patterns we will then provide recommendations on what natural disasters to prepare for and when they may occur.  

### The Data

The dataset used is an OpenFEMA Dataset for Disaster Declarations and can be found at the following source: https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/disaster-declarations-summaries-v2
