# Phase 4 Project: Times Series Modeling

## Project Overview

In this project we are using a time series model to understand the patterns of natural disasters declarations in the United States. By understanding these patterns we will then provide recommendations on what natural disasters to prepare for and when they may occur.  

### The Data

The dataset used is an OpenFEMA Dataset for Disaster Declarations and can be found at the following source: https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/disaster-declarations-summaries-v2 

### ARIMA Modeling

Using ARIMA Modeling I predicted the future of top three natural disasters to most commonly occur in the U.S. This modeling looked at the occurance of natural disaster up to 36 months in the future from 01-01-2020. The ARIMA modeling provided a predicted value,

### Conclusion

The top three natural disasters in the U.S.A since 1970 that I studied are:

- Severe Storms - 

- Hurricanes - 

- Floods -

### Future Work:

With greater time and scope I would pursue the following additions to the project:

1. Research areas of the U.S.
2. Biological Natural Disasters
3. COVID-19 & other possible pandemics
4. Snow, Fire, & Ice
5. Funding allocation
